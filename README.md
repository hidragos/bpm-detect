# ðŸŽµ BPM Tap ðŸŽµ

A simple BPM detector that allows you to tap along to the beat. I personally use this kind of tool when sampling music and I need to know the tempo of a track.

There are very many similar tools out there but I wanted to create my own version with a fancy design and some cool animations.
